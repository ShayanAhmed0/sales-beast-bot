## Voice & Behavior System Design

### Voice Synthesis Architecture

The voice synthesis system leverages ElevenLabs' advanced text-to-speech capabilities with the following specifications:

**Core Features:**
- Ultra-realistic voice synthesis using ElevenLabs Eleven v3 model
- Automatic multilingual support with language and accent adaptation
- Real-time emotion control and tone adjustment
- Natural interruption handling and conversation flow management

**Implementation Details:**
The voice synthesis engine will be implemented as a dedicated microservice that interfaces with ElevenLabs API. The service will maintain voice profiles for different industries and personas, allowing dynamic switching based on the target lead's profile and industry.

```python
class VoiceSynthesisEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.elevenlabs_client = ElevenLabsClient(api_key=os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY'))
        self.voice_profiles = self.load_voice_profiles()
        
    def synthesize_speech(self, text, emotion, voice_profile, language='en'):
        # Apply emotion tags and natural speech patterns
        enhanced_text = self.apply_emotion_tags(text, emotion)
        enhanced_text = self.add_natural_patterns(enhanced_text)
        
        # Generate speech with specified voice profile
        audio = self.elevenlabs_client.generate(
            text=enhanced_text,
            voice=voice_profile,
            model="eleven_multilingual_v2"
        )
        
        return audio
```

### Natural Human-like Behaviors

The system implements sophisticated behavioral patterns to achieve 101% human-like interactions:

**Pause Management:**
- Strategic pauses before answering complex questions (1-3 seconds)
- Natural breathing patterns integrated into speech flow
- Contextual pause duration based on question complexity

**Filler Words and Expressions:**
- Dynamic insertion of natural filler words: "Hmm... let me think", "Well...", "You know..."
- Contextually appropriate expressions based on conversation flow
- Regional and cultural adaptation of speech patterns

**Emotional Responsiveness:**
- Real-time sentiment analysis of customer responses
- Dynamic tone adjustment (calm, excited, empathetic, urgent)
- Emotional mirroring to build rapport

**Interruption Handling:**
- Immediate speech cessation upon customer interruption detection
- Graceful resumption with contextual acknowledgment
- Memory retention of interrupted content for later reference

        self.strategy_model = self.load_negotiation_model()
        self.industry_strategies = self.load_industry_strategies()
        
    def adapt_strategy(self, customer_response, current_strategy, lead_profile):
        # Analyze customer sentiment and engagement
        sentiment_score = self.analyze_sentiment(customer_response)
        engagement_level = self.assess_engagement(customer_response)
        
        # Determine optimal strategy adjustment
        new_strategy = self.strategy_model.predict(
            features=[sentiment_score, engagement_level, lead_profile]
        )
        
        return new_strategy
```

## Conversational Memory System

### Session Memory Architecture

The conversational memory system maintains detailed context throughout each call session:

        self.persistent_storage = PostgreSQLConnection()
        
    def store_session_data(self, call_id, customer_data, conversation_log):
        # Store session data in both memory and persistent storage
        self.session_memory[call_id] = {
            'customer_data': customer_data,
            'conversation_log': conversation_log,
            'key_insights': self.extract_insights(conversation_log)
        }
        
        # Persist to database for future reference
        self.persistent_storage.store_call_data(call_id, self.session_memory[call_id])
        
    def retrieve_customer_history(self, customer_phone):
        # Retrieve previous interactions for context
        return self.persistent_storage.get_customer_history(customer_phone)

            'referral_mentioned': 15
        }
        
    def calculate_score(self, conversation_data):
        total_score = 0
        for event, points in self.scoring_rules.items():
            if self.detect_event(conversation_data, event):
                total_score += points

    def schedule_follow_up(self, lead_data, conversation_outcome):
        # Determine optimal follow-up timing
        follow_up_time = self.scheduling_algorithm.predict_optimal_time(
            lead_data, conversation_outcome
        )
        
        # Schedule automated follow-up with updated pitch
        updated_pitch = self.generate_updated_pitch(lead_data, conversation_outcome)
        
        return {
            'scheduled_time': follow_up_time,
            'pitch_strategy': updated_pitch,
