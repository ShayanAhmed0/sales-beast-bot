Create a private, production-ready, ultra-powerful AI Voice Sales Agent 
designed to convert leads into paying clients at the highest possible rate. 
This agent must sound 101% human, capable of real phone conversations 
that include natural pauses, laughs, hesitations, and thinking moments. 
It must operate as a persuasive, empathetic, and adaptive sales closer 
for multiple industries such as restaurants, cafes, car services, AI receptionists, 
and more. The system is solely for private in-house use.

=== VOICE & BEHAVIOR ===
- Ultra-realistic voice synthesis using ElevenLabs or Hume AI with emotion control.
- Automatic multilingual support with language and accent adaptation.
- Natural human-like behaviors:
  • Short pauses before answering tough questions.
  • Occasional filler words: “Hmm… let me think.”
  • Light chuckles or laughs when appropriate.
  • Tone changes with user sentiment (calm, excited, empathetic, urgent).
- Handles interruptions gracefully: stops speaking, listens, and resumes naturally.
- Uses empathy and persuasion phrases like a seasoned human sales rep.

=== SALES ENGINE ===
- Accepts daily lead lists (CSV, Excel, or CRM sync).
- Auto-dials leads using Twilio or Agora and records conversations.
- Sales playbooks for industries (restaurants, cafes, car services, etc.) loaded dynamically.
- Objection handling:
  • If cost is mentioned: offer value justification or a discount strategy.
  • If hesitant: provide reassurance, share social proof, or create urgency.
  • If uninterested: pivot with tailored benefits based on industry.
- Always drive to a call-to-action: booking, signup, deposit, or appointment.
- Negotiation logic adapts mid-call based on the lead’s reactions.

=== CONVERSATIONAL MEMORY ===
- Remembers details within each session: customer name, business needs, objections.
- References them later in the call naturally to build rapport and trust.
- Stores transcripts with lead status for follow-ups.

=== DATA MANAGEMENT ===
- Logs each call: transcript, duration, sentiment score, conversion result.
- Updates private CRM or lead database automatically.
- Scoring system:
  +20 points if an email is captured,
  +25 if budget is discussed,
  +15 if timeline is given,
  +20 if a pain point is identified,
  +30 if appointment confirmed.

=== FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION ===
- After call, send SMS/email confirmation using Twilio/SendGrid.
- For undecided leads, schedule automatic re-calls with updated pitch.
- Keep contact history per lead for intelligent follow-up.

=== ANALYTICS DASHBOARD ===
- Real-time tracking: calls made, leads contacted, conversions.
- Sentiment analysis of conversations.
- Objection type breakdown with success rates.
- Conversion funnel visualization.
- Exportable daily/weekly reports.

=== TECH STACK ===
- Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI).
- Voice: ElevenLabs/Hume AI (TTS), Whisper/Deepgram (STT).
- Telephony: Twilio/Agora.
- LLM: GPT-4 with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context.
- Database: PostgreSQL (with MongoDB for logs).
- Dashboard: React + Tailwind with Grafana for analytics.

=== UNIQUE ADVANCED BEHAVIORS ===
- Emotion-driven selling: detects hesitation or excitement and adjusts strategy.
- Simulates real thought: “One sec, I’m pulling that up…” + pause.
- Dynamic persona switching: can sell across industries without retraining.
- Multi-attempt follow-ups until a deal is closed.
- Adaptive learning: updates objection-handling tactics based on previous calls.

=== DELIVERABLES ===
- Fully coded backend and frontend ready to run locally.
- Config system (.env) for API keys (GPT-4, ElevenLabs, Twilio, CRM, SendGrid).
- End-to-end demo: 
   • Bot auto-dials a lead from provided list.
   • Conducts natural conversation with laughter, pauses, and persuasion.
   • Closes the appointment or sale.
   • Sends SMS/email confirmation.
   • Logs details and updates CRM.
